This is a React web application built using TypeScript that handles sick leave applications. The app allows users to create and delete sick leave applications, and it provides a user-friendly interface for managing these requests. The app also utilizes Zustand as a state-management solution and TanStack Query in conjunction with Firebase for data retrieval and management. Additionally, it incorporates React Router to enable protected routes and user role-based content. With these features, the app provides an efficient and secure way to manage sick leave applications based on user roles.
